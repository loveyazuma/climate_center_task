# Climate Profile - Central African Republic

This repository contains all the code and analysis for climate data related to Central Africa. The project is divided into two main parts:

## Part 1: Historic Climate Profile (1901 - 2022)

In this first part of my analysis, I explore the historic climate profile of the Central African Republic, covering the period from 1901 to 2022. The data used for this analysis was sourced from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. I've focused on key climate variables, including:

- **Precipitation (pre)**: Analyzing historical precipitation data to uncover trends, anomalies, and patterns over the past century.

- **Temperature (tmp)**: Investigating historical temperature data to understand temperature trends, changes, and seasonal variations.

- **Diurnal Temperature Range (dtr)**: Exploring diurnal temperature range data to gain insights into daily temperature variations and climate variability.

## Part 2: Projected Climate Trends under SSP Scenarios

In the second part of my analysis, I shift my focus to the future by examining projected climate trends under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios. I've used climate data from the CMIP6 (IPSL-CM6A-LR) model, which I obtained from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS). The following SSP scenarios have been analyzed:

- **SSP1-1.6**: A sustainable development scenario with stringent climate policies.
  
- **SSP1-2.6**: A sustainable development scenario with moderate climate policies.
  
- **SSP2-4.5**: An intermediate scenario with stabilized radiative forcing.
  
- **SSP3-7.0**: A scenario characterized by regional rivalry and fragmentation with high greenhouse gas emissions.
  
- **SSP4-6.0**: A scenario characterized by inequality and fossil fuel use.
  
- **SSP5-8.5**: A scenario with high greenhouse gas emissions and increased global warming.

For each SSP scenario, I analyze the projected temperature and precipitation trends for the Central African Republic, providing insights into potential future climate conditions.

## Data Sources
